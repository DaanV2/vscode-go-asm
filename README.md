A vscode extension for showing you Go's assembly output next with your Go code.

When you open a Go file, you can use the context menu or the command palette to open the assembly view. By selecting `Show Go Assembly`, a new editor will open displaying the assembly code generated by the Go compiler for the current file.

If you save the Go file, the assembly view will automatically update to reflect any changes.
